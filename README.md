# Backend API for Swedeb

This repository contains the backend API for the Swedeb project. It is a Python application built with the FastAPI framework, designed to serve data to the frontend and handle complex queries.

## Technology Stack

The backend is built on a containerized architecture, leveraging modern Python tooling and best practices.

*   **[Python 3.12](https://www.python.org/)**: The core programming language.
*   **[The IMS Open Corpus Workbench](https://sourceforge.net/projects/cwb/)**: Tools for managing and querying large text corpora.
*   **[FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/)**: A high-performance web framework for building APIs.
*   **[Docker](https://www.docker.com/)**: For containerizing the application, ensuring a consistent environment. The final image is built on a custom base image that includes CWB (Corpus Workbench) functionality.
*   **[GitHub Container Registry (GHCR)](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-container-registry)**: For hosting the final Docker application image.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.12+
- Poetry
- Docker (optional, for containerized development)

### Local Development Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/humlab-swedeb/swedeb-api.git
    cd swedeb-api
    ```

2.  **Install Poetry:**
    Follow the [official installation instructions](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation).

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    poetry install
    ```

4.  **Run the Development Server:**
    ```bash
    poetry run uvicorn api_swedeb.main:app --reload
    ```

### Commit Convention

This project uses [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for automatic versioning and changelog generation.

**Format:**
```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

**Common types:**
- `feat:` - New feature (triggers minor version bump)
- `fix:` - Bug fix (triggers patch version bump)
- `docs:` - Documentation changes (no release)
- `chore:` - Maintenance tasks (no release)
- `BREAKING CHANGE:` - Breaking changes (triggers major version bump)

**Examples:**
```bash
# New feature
git commit -m "feat: add user authentication endpoint"

# Bug fix
git commit -m "fix: resolve database connection timeout"

# Documentation
git commit -m "docs: update API usage examples"

# Breaking change
git commit -m "feat!: redesign API response format

BREAKING CHANGE: All endpoints now return JSON instead of XML"
```

### Development Workflow

1. Create a feature branch from `dev`
2. Make changes and commit using conventional commits
3. Open a Pull Request to `dev`
4. After review and merge, changes flow through: `dev` â†’ `test` â†’ `staging` â†’ `main`

See the [Workflow Guide](docs/WORKFLOW_GUIDE.md) for detailed information.

## Automated Release & Deployment

This project uses a fully automated CI/CD pipeline with semantic versioning:

- **Push to `test` branch** â†’ Builds test environment images
- **Push to `staging` branch** â†’ Builds staging environment images  
- **Push to `main` branch** â†’ Triggers semantic-release:
  - Analyzes commits to determine version bump
  - Updates CHANGELOG.md
  - Creates GitHub Release with artifacts
  - Builds and publishes production Docker images
  - Commits version updates back to main

See the [Deployment Guide](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md) for complete deployment instructions.

## Testing CI/CD Locally with `act`

To test GitHub Actions workflows locally:

1.  **Install `act`:** Follow the [official installation instructions](https://github.com/nektos/act#installation).

2.  **Create a Personal Access Token (PAT):**
    - Go to GitHub Settings â†’ Developer settings â†’ Personal access tokens â†’ Tokens (classic)
    - Generate token with scopes: `repo`, `workflow`, `write:packages`
    - Save to `~/.ghcr_token`

3.  **Run workflows locally:**
    ```bash
    # Test the release workflow
    act -j release -s GITHUB_TOKEN="$(cat ~/.ghcr_token)"
    ```
